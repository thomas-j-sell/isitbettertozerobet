# isitbettertozerobet
While playing Sporcle live trivia my team often argues about weather or not we should zero bet on the final question.  This site seeks to collect and analyze data to help make that decision.

### Explanation
Manually compile data on whether or not it would have been a better idea to zero bet.

Using [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org), create a pie chart of collected Sporcle live zero bet data.

Make a determination as to whether or not zero betting is a statistically good idea.

### Eventuallyâ€¦
* Store data in mysql database
* Ability to enter data from the website
* Allow teams should be able to upload their data (crowdsourcing ftw)
